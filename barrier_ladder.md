Barrier ladder
--------------

| Step | State |
|:---|:---|
| Awareness | I don't know the brand |
| Understanding |  I know the brand, but I don't know what it's for |
| Relevance | I know the brand, I know what it's for, but I consider that it's not for me |
| Credibility | I know the brand, I know that it's for, I consider it's for me, but I don't believe it works |
| Superiority | I know the brand, I know that it's for, I consider it's for me, I believe it works, but I have another remedy for that, that I consider superior |
| Negative | The brand is perfect, but I have a pratical problem -- price, taste, category rejection, etc |
